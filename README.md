# InterSystems Server-Side Workspace Root Tuner

This extension allows you to tune InterSystems server-side workspace root folders as you work, toggling whether or not they show mapped, generated and system items.

## Use

1. Invoke the context menu on a workspace root folder that accesses code files on an InterSystems server using the isfs or isfs-readonly scheme.
2. Use the options contributed by this extension to show or hide mapped, generated or system items.
